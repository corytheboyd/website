# Website

https://corytheboyd.com

My personal website. Built with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), [PostHTML](https://posthtml.org/), [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Why not Hugo/Jekyll/etc.

* I don't change my website frequently enough to warrant billions of features I will forget how to use anyway
* TailwindCSS is more than enough on its own to make a great looking website, and it's very well documented
* PostHTML and it's plugin ecosystem offers just enough templating features to avoid document duplication, and that's it

The goal was to make something insanely easy to make very infrequent edits to, and I think I delivered on that. Time will tell, I suppose :)

## Development

Run the development server:

```
npm start
```
