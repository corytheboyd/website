          OMG where is your LinkedIn profile?!?!?
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I don't need LinkedIn to collate my work experience, so I deleted my
          profile.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can do that myself, without handing over personal data to
          spam-vertising behemoths, by writing a resume.

          Okay... BUT WHERE IS YOUR TWITTER?!?!

          Mass social media is garbage.

        <p>
          We tried, and we failed. Shut it down and let's move on with our
          lives. Find another gratification loop to engage in that is grounded
          in reality.

          Federated networks through ActivityPub are the next logical step for
          online communities that won't get too big to be good, and won't be
          sold out for short-term profit.

        <p>
          No you don't. You are yet another uninspired participant in the AI
          gold rush. Your goal is to grift rubes out of their hard-earned cash.

          LLMs are lauded under a false narrative of anthropomorphic wank. They
          might be useful after the dust settles for certain workloads.

          I don't need you to create 50% accurate summaries of my email inbox.
          I know all you want to do is sell my Precious User Data ™️ to
          advertisers. Jog on.

          So, do you enjoy anything in life?
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Yes! Many things!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am fond of my employer, the team I get to work with, and my
          employers acknowledgement that I work to live.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am grateful for the beautiful setting I get to live in, and the
          amazing friends and family that I have.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am afforded the opportunity to satisfy my technical, musical, and
          other such curiosities. I do so regularly. Or if I'm not feeling it I
          play some video games. Life is good!
