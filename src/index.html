          <blockquote>OMG where is your LinkedIn profile?!?!?</blockquote>
          <p>
            I don't need LinkedIn to collate my work experience, so I deleted my
            profile.
          </p>
          <p>
            I can do that myself, without handing over personal data to
            spam-vertising behemoths, by writing a resume.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Okay... wait, you don't use TWITTER either?!?! What is wrong with
            you!
          </blockquote>
          <p>Social media is garbage.</p>
          <p>
            We tried, and we failed. Shut it down and let's move on with our
            lives.
          </p>
          <blockquote>So, do you... enjoy anything?</blockquote>
          <p>Yes! Many things!</p>
          <p>
            I am afforded the opportunity to satisfy my technical, musical, and
            other such curiosities with regularity.
          </p>
          <p>
            My job isn't actively trying to kill me. I don't have to pray to the
            corporate mascot every morning to receive a paycheck. I get time to
            do things right, learn new technologies, grow alongside other
            pleasant folks, and don't live in constant fear of the pager going
            off.
          </p>
          <p>Life is good!</p>
          <blockquote>
            Are people really asking you these questions, and frequently?
          </blockquote>
          <p>Nope, you caught me! ðŸ˜…</p>
          <p>
            This is merely a cheeky way to talk about myself, which I figured
            was apt for a personal website.
