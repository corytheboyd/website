      <blockquote>
        OMG where is your LinkedIn profile?!?!?
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I don't need LinkedIn to collate my work experience, so I deleted my
        profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can do that myself, without handing over personal data to
        spam-vertising behemoths, by writing a resume.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Okay... wait, you don't use TWITTER either?!?! What is wrong with you!
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Mass social media is garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
        We tried, and we failed. Shut it down and let's move on with our
        lives. Find another gratification loop to engage in that is grounded
        in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Federated networks through ActivityPub seem like the next logical step
        for online communities that won't be ruined by Too Many People, and
        won't be sold to advertisers for short-term profit.

        We have an exciting opportunity for you at a fast-paced AI startup
        that will change the world with chatbots
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        No you don't. You are yet another uninspired participant in the AI
        gold rush. Your goal is to grift rubes out of their hard-earned cash.
      </p>
      <p>
        LLMs are lauded under a false narrative of anthropomorphic wank. They
        might be useful after the dust settles for certain workloads, but
        we're still going through the hysterical stupidity phase.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        So, do you... enjoy anything?
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Yes! Many things!
      </p>
      <p>
        I am afforded the opportunity to satisfy my technical, musical, and
        other such curiosities with regularity.
      </p>
      <p>
        My job isn't actively trying to kill me. I don't have to pray to the
        corporate mascot every morning to receive a paycheck. I get
        time to do things right, learn new technologies, grow alongside other
        pleasant folks, and don't live in constant fear of the pager going off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Life is good!

      <blockquote>
        Are people really asking you these questions, and frequently?
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Nope, you caught me! ðŸ˜…
      </p>
      <p>
        This is merely a cheeky way to talk about myself, which I figured was
        apt content to display on a personal website.
