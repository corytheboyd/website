My personal website. Build with `gulp`, `postcss`, and `posthtml` using `TailwindCSS` for styling.

I decided to ditch Hugo after not being able to remember its esoteric conventions... for my own esoteric conventions comprised of `posthtml` plugins (`posthtml-include`, `posthtml-expressions`, and `posthtml-content`).

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which is automatically built and deployed by GitHub Actions. This stack allows me to host the site for free, nice!
