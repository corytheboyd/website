I recently took it upon myself to get more serious about building a reputation in the software engineering community, and what better way to contribute than through a personal blog!

The first step here, of course, is to create said blog. In doing so, I setup some rules to stick to while I assemble the needed resources and knowledge to pull this off.

What follows in this post are the decisions I made along with justifications for what I picked and against what I didn't pick. My goal is to inspire others to create their own personal websites, get my own voice out there and heard, and to just have fun with it!

So, let's talk about building this website!

## Rules of engagement

Being the man of principle that I am, I established some rules for building this website before getting started. I wasn't going to force the solution to conform if it meant delivery of something subpar, but I vowed to give the ol' college try.

{{< figure src="https://media.giphy.com/media/dxPffVjOhrC4U/source.gif" caption="Man's gotta have a code" >}}

My rules for this website were as follows:

1. It has to be free across the board
1. No JavaScript anywhere in the stack
1. Avoid markup/styling duplication
1. No frivolous unused features

In the end I was able to adhere to these rules for the most part, mission accomplished! I created something that I now quite enjoy working with, so let's next enumerate the implementation details and explain the rationale behind the decisions made!

## The stack

1. Domain & DNS
    1. [Google Domains](https://domains.google/)
    1. [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
1. Hosting
    1. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
1. Content management
    1. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
1. Deployment
    1. [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
        1. [peaceiris/actions-hugo](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-hugo)
        1. [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)

I guess you could call it the GDCGHPGHA stack? Not every collection of tools needs a cute name and a manifesto, it's just as valid to lean on your own knowledge and experience to solve problems as it is to use well adopted technology stacks, just pick the right tool for the right job!

### Google Domains

The only part of the stack that you cannot get for free is of course the domain name.

I use Google Domains a my registrar. It's a bit of a strange choice, because the first thing I do after registering a domain through them is change the nameservers to Cloudflare. When you do this you opt out of some nice features like [painless email forwarding](https://domains.google/getting-started/email/) and [synthetic DNS records](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/6069273?hl=en).

So... maybe I should just find a new registrar? The return on investment here is too small to deal with it right now, so I'll likely revisit this later. 

### Cloudflare

I hardly scratch the surface of the Cloudflare offering, but I use it mostly for these two features:

1. Origin fault tolerance
1. Just Enough™ analytics

Origin fault tolerance just means that if GitHub pages is unavailable my website will be served from the Cloudflare cache instead. An unlikely occurrence, of course, but if protection against it is free we have nothing to lose.

GitHub Pages, to my knowledge, doesn't expose analytics data. I don't need (or want) Google Analytics, but I do at least want to know if content I release is being consumed. Cloudflare exposes exactly that, and it works perfectly fine for my use case (a tiny blog).

{{< figure src="/posts/2020-08-01-this-blog/cloudflare-analytics.png" caption="The Cloudflare analytics page" >}}

I made the following changes to the default caching configuration settings:
1. Caching configuration
    1. Always Online™: **enabled**
    1. Development Mode: **enabled**

Always Online means your content will be served from cache if the origin server (GitHub Pages) is unavailable, and Development Mode disables caching entirely.

I have a mental not to turn Developer Mode off once I am ready to go live, as it simply forwards all requests directly to the origin server. This makes changes go live faster, but puts all load on GitHub Pages, which puts us at risk of being shut off by GitHub, more on that in the next section.

## GitHub Pages

I *loathe* setting up infrastructure, despite finding it fascinating when systems come together in perfect harmony.

GitHub Pages is just a no-nonsense CDN for static content that lives directly inside of the remote code repository that I already use to host my sites source code. It takes almost no setup to go live, deploys are lightning fast... what's the catch?

### Limitations of GitHub Pages

The first catch is that a GitHub Pages repository cannot exceed 1GB. You won't hit this limit with plain text content, but once you start introducing images it won't take long.

The second catch is that GitHub will reportedly shutoff access to your content if the request volume is deemed to be too high. The limit is neither explicitly defined nor is there a way to tell if you're at risk.

If you can stomach both of these risks, it makes for a solid way to get started for free! You should keep it in the back of your mind though that eventually you will have to cross the bridge and take on some infrastructure of your own, but that is a great problem to have because it means there is a demand for your content, congratulations!

### Mitigating the GitHub shutoff with Cloudflare

Note that the Always Online™️ feature we enabled previously in Cloudflare should in theory cover your ass if GitHub deems your page too hot to handle. You won't be able to publish new content, or even change old content if you've been shutoff, but it at least keeps your content in front of the eyes of the crowd that bombed it with love in the first place!

Hopefully you had a plan for rolling your own infrastructure, maybe I'll run into the situation above and have to live through this myself. If that happens, expect a nice blog post about it ;)

## Content management

It wouldn't be a website without content! I thought about forgoing a CMS entirely at first, but it only took one day of choking on duplicated markup and getting lost in muddy CSS rules (vanilla CSS). Once I caught my precious little brain pondering the path of "what if I used Web Components, <template> and <slot>, and Shadow DOM to reduce duplication" I shut it all down and admitted that it was time to find a CMS.

I ended up settling for Hugo because it was the only *currently popular* solution (key words being current and popular) I could find that satisfied both of the following:

1. No JavaScript anywhere in the stack
1. Avoid markup/styling duplication

Hugo was somehow the only solution left on my short list made it the winner by default, making the CMS decision very easy for me. Before I talk more about my experiences with Hugo, some quick notes on why I *didn't* reach for any of the other offerings.

### Against the Hugo alternatives

*Every* other CMS on my short list had some sort of JavaScript dependency. They were either using React or Vue instead of HTML templates, or depended on JavaScript build processes like Webpack. The one exception was [Ghost](https://github.com/getgrav/grav), but that is powered by PHP, which I would prefer to keep out of my life entirely.

We already have a great view abstraction for the web, it's HTML and CSS. The only justification for including a JS view library would be to leverage proprietary components from it's respective ecosystem, but this is *a blog*, need I say more?

"But what about server-side rendered React! That delivers HTML just like Hugo!" What the client receives is indeed HTML, you are correct there, but this approach requires running a process to build that content from its respective JavaScript source *as it is requested*. Step back and assess this like you would any other technical implementation, and see that it is an insane amount of work just to... get around serving static documents? Serving static documents is about as simple as it gets, and simple solutions tend not to break as often as complex ones.

### From zero to Hugo

In line with my goal of not adding frivolous unused features to source code, I chose not to introduce a theme. Turns out this ends up creating a broken site by default, and the errors reported aren't particularly helpful.

It started to dawn on me why the [getting started documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) includes adding a theme, because that would have included the missing boilerplate to get content rendering on the page.

I was missing default layouts, most importantly the `baseof.html` file which is the **entire chrome of the website**! Why that isn't included in the code generated by `hugo new` I have no idea. 

Things started to click much more quickly after swallowing my pride and watching the [fantastic tutorial videos by Mike Dane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3&v=qtIqKaDlqXo), which are often referenced in the Hugo documentation.

### Obligatory JavaScript rant

You may be wondering why I want anything to do with JavaScript. I know how people look at me when I express my distaste for JavaScript, but I stand by it.

During my tenure as a professional software engineer working with small/mid sized technology companies, I dare say that nothing has caused more fundamental and systemic issues than JavaScript. 

I am going to stop the rant there, but you can count on me expanding on this topic in a future post ;)

## Deployment

I knew right away that GitHub Actions was going to be perfect for this, given their free offering for public repositories. Quite simply, it's a simple method of running deployment code on push to a branch.

{{< figure src="/posts/2020-08-01-this-blog/gh_actions_example_build.png" caption="The end result of the integration, a successful 10 second build" >}}

I knew ahead of time that I needed to setup the git branches correctly:
1. `master`: Website source code
1. `gh-pages`: Website static content served through GitHub pages

When the `hugo` command is run without any arguments, it builds the site into a `public` directory, which is exactly what we want to push into the `gh-pages` branch. So, let's get this to happen in the GitHub actions job!

Feel free to reference my [GitHub actions configuration file](https://github.com/corytheboyd/website/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml), which is fairly self explanatory. Here is a simplified slice of the relevant steps in the build:

{{< gist corytheboyd 72219b9e70776db5c5a76662b8efc80f >}}

Huge shoutout to [Shohei Ueda (peaceiris)](https://github.com/peaceiris) for publishing the GitHub Actions plugins for downloading the Hugo binary and uploading content to the gh-pages branch, that saved me tons of time, I actually only spent about 15 minutes from "I should figure out deployment" to having it completely working, it felt amazing!

## Summary

I hope this was helpful to anyone looking to host their own personal website! It can be hard to know what to use and why when you're getting started, and perhaps my list of selected technologies along with my justifications helps you to create your own setup!

And to conclude this blog post, I just want to say that I don't consider this website finished at all yet! Some things off the top of my head that are on deck:
* Styling needs some love, as it always does
* Formatting for different devices (easy to do, likely the next thing I tackle)
* Hosting non-text assets on another CDN (and incorporate into the build/deploy process)
* Get people to actually read and appreciate what I have to say ;)
